# macOS (if using Homebrew Python)
brew install python-tk
```

**❌ "Permission denied" when creating backups:**
- Ensure write permissions in the application directory
- Run as administrator/sudo if necessary (not recommended)
- Change backup directory in settings

**❌ "API rate limit exceeded":**
- Application automatically switches to backup data sources
- Wait for rate limit reset (usually 1 hour)
- Configure additional API keys for Alpha Vantage/Polygon

**❌ "Memory usage too high":**
- Reduce cache size in settings
- Enable aggressive garbage collection
- Close unnecessary applications
- Increase system RAM if possible

**❌ "Slow response times":**
- Enable data compression
- Reduce number of parallel requests
- Check internet connection speed
- Clear old cache files

#### 📋 **Log Files Location**
- **Application logs**: `logs/stockedu_YYYYMMDD.log`
- **Error records**: `logs/error_records.json`
- **Performance logs**: `logs/performance.log`
- **Data integrity**: `data_integrity.log`

#### 🆘 **Emergency Recovery**
If the application fails to start:
1. Check `logs/` directory for error messages
2. Run emergency recovery: `python -c "from src.core.data_integrity import DataIntegrityManager; DataIntegrityManager().emergency_recovery()"`
3. Clear cache: Delete `cache/` directory
